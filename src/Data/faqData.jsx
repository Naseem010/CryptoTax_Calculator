    question: "How are cryptocurrencies taxed in Australia?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) regards cryptocurrency as both
        property, which is subject to Capital Gains Tax (CGT), and income, which
        is subject to Income Tax. CGT applies when you sell, trade, gift, or
        make purchases using cryptocurrency. On the other hand, Income Tax
        applies when you receive cryptocurrency as payment for services, work,
        mining, staking, or other activities. To simplify tax calculations,
        consider using a free crypto tax calculator for Australia.

    question:
      "What’s the difference between long-term and short-term capital gains?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        The distinction between long-term and short-term capital gains lies in
        the duration of ownership. When you own an asset, such as
        cryptocurrency, for more than 12 months, any gains from its sale are
        categorized as long-term. These long-term gains often receive a 50%
        discount on the capital gains tax (CGT). In contrast, if you hold the
        asset for 12 months or less, the gains are considered short-term, and
        they are taxed at your regular income tax rate.

    question: "Do I have to pay tax on crypto-to-crypto transactions?",
    answer: (
      <div>
        <p>
          Yes, according to the ATO, when you trade one cryptocurrency for
          another, like NFTs, stablecoins, or tokens, it's seen as selling one
          asset to buy another, and any profit you make from this exchange is
          subject to Capital Gains Tax. To compute taxes for crypto-to-crypto
          transactions, you must determine the fair market value of your coins
          in AUD at both the acquisition and disposal times. However, this can
          be challenging because many exchanges use cryptocurrency as the
          standard for valuation.

        The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) possesses strong tracking
        capabilities for cryptocurrency transactions. Since 2014, they've been
        gathering data on crypto activities, including KYC info from exchanges
        and wallets. The ATO's data matching program, active since 2019, lets
        them access data from service providers like Binance and CoinJar,
        covering personal details and transaction specifics. Since 2020, the ATO
        has been notifying Australian crypto investors to report holdings to
        avoid penalties.

    answer: (
      <p>
        Transferring cryptocurrency from one wallet to another that you own in
        Australia is not subject to tax, as it is not recognised as a taxable
        event, and capital gains tax is not triggered. Nevertheless, it's
        essential to keep detailed records of these transfers, particularly if
        you are utilizing automated crypto tax software like KoinX. KoinX, as a
        reliable crypto tax software, can streamline the process, making it
        easier to maintain accurate and efficient tax records and reporting
        while ensuring compliance with Australian tax regulations.

          To calculate your crypto tax in Australia accurately, you need to

        <p className="font-bold my-2 text-base text-black">Income Tax</p>
        <p className="">
          In Australia, when an individual (investor) sells, trades, spends,
          earns (salary, mining, interest) or gifts cryptocurrency, the net
          capital gain is taxed at the same rate as their Income Tax. This tax
          rate is determined based on their total income for the tax year.
